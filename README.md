# Parkarr-Android-App

Parkarr (http://www.parkarr.com/#intro) is a crowd-sourced app for street parking in New York City.

As an intern for Parkarr, I contributed to developing the initial version the Android version of the app. I taught myself Java and the Android development environment to implement the welcome tour for the application.
